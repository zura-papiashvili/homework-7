            <h2 id="positioning">Positioning</h2>
            <p>Positioning is the process of specifying the position of an element in relation to another element or to
                the browser window itself. It is very powerful and quite complex. It is also the most commonly used
                method of positioning elements on a web page.</p>
            <p>There are four different types of positioning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Static</li>
                <li>Relative</li>
                <li>Absolute</li>
                <li>Fixed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Static positioning is the default positioning of an element. It is always positioned according to the
                normal flow of the page. It is not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</p>
            <p>Relative positioning is the positioning of an element relative to its normal position. It is positioned
                according to the normal flow of the page, and then offset by the top, bottom, left, and right
                properties. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</p>
            <p>Absolute positioning is the positioning of an element relative to its containing element. It is
                positioned according to the normal flow of the page, and then offset by the top, bottom, left, and right
                properties. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</p>
            <p>Fixed positioning is the positioning of an element relative to the browser window. It is positioned
                according to the normal flow of the page, and then offset by the top, bottom, left, and right
                properties. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</p>
            <p>When you specify the position of an element, it is important to specify the width and height properties.
                Otherwise, the element will be sized according to its content.</p>
